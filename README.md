# Primary-Salinization-Model
This code includes a parsimonious model of primary (i.e., natural) soil salinization. It solves the balance equations for the vertically-averaged relative soil moisture and salt mass dynamics under stochastic rainfall inputs and accounts for seasonality and vegetation-salinity feedbacks.
